# Device Info Demo

Simplest possible demo website used during a cybersecurity-related presentation to show what basic info can be learned about a person simply through the browser.

If you're reading this, you got here either by following the link in the DevTools console, or by somehow stumbling across it here on my GitHub. In any way, I don't plan on investing more time into this project. It's available for educational purposes.
